I was able to achieve a depth of 4 on my computer, the ai quite frankly doesnt work great but Im suprised it atleast somewhat works. Overall my challenges came a lot from health, I got sick a lot and had some other issues which led to me falling behind in all my classes and I had to abandon bit boards. This ended up biting me in the ass as I made a quite terrible function to decide legal moves that didnt take strings as an input, this led to a quite complex generation of moves. Overall though it was really satisfying the first time my chess ai didnt make a horrible move and was a very fulfilling experience.
